,,"Human or animal (whole organism) without restriction based on age, sex, or life stage at exposure or outcome assessment
Any exposure/stressors at any life stage as long as the study design (i.e., outcome measurement stage) was transgenerational in nature 
Humans: a comparison population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than the more highly exposed subjects.
Animals: comparable animal populations exposed to vehicle-only treatment in experimental studies or a comparison animal population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than more highly exposed animals in wildlife/farm animals.
the comparison groups are defined at the time of exposure and therefore apply to the F0 generation (which in a gestational exposure would include exposure of the offspring (F1) and its gametes (F2).
