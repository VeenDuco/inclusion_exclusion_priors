The population is adult or pediatric patients with spasticity or a musculoskeletal condition. We defined spasticity as muscle spasms associated with an upper motor neuron syndrome. Musculoskeletal conditions were defined as peripheral conditions resulting in muscle or soft tissue pain or spasms.
oral drugs classified as skeletal muscle relaxants: baclofen, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, dantrolene, metaxalone, methocarbamol, orphenadrine, and tizanidine.
The main efficacy measures were relief of muscle spasms or pain, functional status, quality of life, withdrawal rates, and adverse effects (including sedation, weakness, addiction, and abuse).
Systematic reviews of the clinical efficacy or adverse event rates of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity or musculoskeletal conditions, OR Randomized controlled trials that compared one of the included skeletal muscle relaxants listed to another included skeletal muscle relaxant, an antispasticity medication from a different drug class, or placebo in adult patients with spasticity or musculoskeletal conditions, OR Randomized controlled trials and large, high quality observational studies that reported adverse event rates for an included skeletal muscle relaxant.",0

Other medications used for spasticity but considered to be in another drug class, such as benzodiazepines, quinine, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and clonidine, were not considered primary drugs in this report, but were reviewed when they were directly compared to an included skeletal muscle relaxant.
trials in which an included skeletal muscle relaxant was combined with an analgesic medication unless the comparison arm included the same analgesic medication and dose, trials which evaluated skeletal muscle relaxants not approved in the United States, and trials which only compared one dose of an included skeletal muscle relaxant with another dose.
non-clinical outcomes such as electromyogram measurements or spring tension measurements.
case reports and case series in which the proportion  of patients suffering an adverse event could not be calculated.
“single-dose” studies, abstracts and unpublished trials unless a pharmaceutical company submitted the full data.",1
