,,"Animal studies on Hist and the amino acids Asn, Asp, GABA, Glu, Gln, Gly, Pro and Tau. Tagged studies were subsequently screened for inclusion in this review based on the following criterion (besides being included in our mapping): studies measuring one or more of the molecules of interest during (1) naturally occurring sleep stages that were validated with polysomnographic measurements and/or (2) during sleep deprivation. To ensure capturing all relevant studies, we searched for studies with the terms “*sleep*”, “*REM*”, “*rest*”, “*fatig*”, and “*somn*” in the title within the studies included in our mapping review.",0
,,"For our mapping review, we excluded (1) studies on other techniques than microdialysis (e.g. biosensors and microdialysis precursors such as push-pull perfusion), (2) studies measuring other substances than Hist and the amino acids Asn, Asp, GABA, Glu, Gln, Gly, Pro and Tau, (3) retro-dialysis studies, (4) microdialysis studies that did not report baseline values without the specified molecules in the perfusion fluid, (5) extra-cerebral microdialysis studies, (6) human and in vitro studies, and (7) papers not containing primary study data. Within publications, experiments using techniques other than microdialysis were also ignored, as well as data on amino acids other than those we searched for. Studies on e.g. carbachol-induced REM-sleep were thus excluded .",1
