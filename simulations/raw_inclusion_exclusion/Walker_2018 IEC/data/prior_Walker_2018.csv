,,"In order to be eligible for inclusion, studies had to satisfy eligibility criteria specified by :  Human or animal (whole organism) without restriction based on age, sex, or life stage at exposure or outcome assessment. Any exposure/stressors at any life stage as long as the study design (i.e., outcome measurement stage) was transgenerational in nature Humans: a comparison population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than the more highly exposed subjects. Animals: comparable animal populations exposed to vehicle-only treatment in experimental studies or a comparison animal population exposed to lower levels (or no exposure/exposure below detection levels) of the stressor than more highly exposed animals in wildlife/farm animals. Note: the comparison groups are defined at the time of exposure and therefore apply to the F0 generation (which in a gestational exposure would include exposure of the offspring (F1) and its gametes (F2).No other restrictions on health outcome or effect measures",1
,,"The following additional criteria were also used for exclusion:
• articles without original data (i.e., reviews, editorials, commentaries)
• studies of non-animal organisms (e.g., plants, fungi)
• in vitro exposure studies
• non-English publications
 Inherited diseases were excluded.",0
