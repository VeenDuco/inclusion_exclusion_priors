,,"The search was not limited by the year of publication. Journal papers and conference proceedings were included.  During the systematic review, we included empirical studies validating and assessing software metrics in the area of software fault prediction. For the selection of primary studies, the following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used.

 Empirical studies (academic and industry) using large and small
scale data sets AND.
 Studies comparing software metrics performance in the area of
software fault prediction.",1
,,"Exclusion criteria:
 Studies without an empirical validation or including experimental
results of software metrics in fault prediction OR.
Studies discussing software metrics in a context other than software
fault prediction (e.g. maintainability) OR.
 Studies discussing modeling techniques (e.g. Naive Bayes, Random
Forest) and not software metrics.

Studies discussing and comparing prediction techniques were
excluded from the review, Studies proposing new software metrics and not empirically
validating them were also excluded",0
