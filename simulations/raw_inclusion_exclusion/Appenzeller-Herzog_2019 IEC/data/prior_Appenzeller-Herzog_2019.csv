,,"We included WD  [Wilson disease] patients of any age or stage. The study drug had to be one of four established therapies, namely DPen [copper chelators D‐penicillamine], trientine, TTM [etrathiomolybdate] or Zn [zinc salts]. The control could be placebo [...]. Concomitant therapies had to be identical in the compared treatment arms (eg trientine plus Zn vs TTM plus Zn).  We included studies that reported all‐cause mortality, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), neurological symptoms (eg dystonia, dysarthria, cognitive decline, drooling, tremor, gait disturbance, chorea, seizure, psychosis), liver‐related symptoms (eg icterus, ascites, steatosis, fibrosis, mild hepatitis, acute liver failure, cirrhosis, serum transaminases), adverse effects (eg dermatological manifestations, nephrotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, autoimmune disorders, anaemia, neutrophilic agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, liver dysfunction, colitis, status dystonicus, myasthenia gravis, arthropathy, macromastia, early neurological deterioration, gastrointestinal irritation), and frequency of treatment discontinuation (ie switching to another drug, stopping or changing the treatment). We included prospective and retrospective studies, including randomized, non‐randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies that were written in English, German, Dutch, French, Spanish or Portuguese.  No publication date restrictions were applied.",1
,,"The control could be placebo but no treatment or any other treatment that does not include the respective study drug (eg Zn [zinc salts] vs trientine was allowed, Zn 50 mg vs Zn 100 mg was not allowed). Comparisons between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens that included the respective monotherapy drug (eg DPen [copper chelators D‐penicillamine] plus Zn vs Zn) have been analysed elsewhere and were not considered any further here. Animal studies, case reports, case series, cross‐sectional studies, before‐after studies, reviews, letters, abstract‐only publications, editorials,  diagnostic or other testing studies and non‐controlled studies were excluded.",0
