,,"the following inclusion criteria: (1) cohort studies or longitudinal studies conducted with routinely collected health care data (e.g., national medical registries or insurance databases); (2) determinant CHD [coronary heart disease] (i.e., myocardial infarction with or without angina or coronary revascularization) or CHF [congestive heart failure]; and (3) report of incident dementia diagnosis as the outcome (i.e., at least all-cause dementia or AD as its most common subtype). We chose all-cause dementia as the main outcome measure of interest for this meta-analysis because a syndrome diagnosis of dementia can be defined with high consistency across studies and is less dependent on advanced diagnostic testing that is often not feasible in large (population-based) studies. 
To provide more insight into the association of CHDandCHFwithdementiaindependentofmanifestcerebrovascular disease, we therefore adopted a clinical diagnosis of AD [Alzheimerâ€™s disease] (per study protocol) as a secondary outcome measure. If multiple results were reported for the same cohort, we preferred the longer follow-up duration, longer follow-up along with more comprehensive assessment of exposure, larger number of incident dementia cases, most contemporary data, or the study in which selection bias was considered least likely.",1
